    "Task-2 is about exploring the potential of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for text classification and more specifically for sentiment analysis [12]. The generic CNN architecture you need to use is depicted in Figure 1. The dataset to be used is the IMDB Movie review dataset described in [16]. It consists of 25 000 positive and 25 000 negative movie reviews and is available for free. There are also 50 000 unlabeled samples which will not be used for this task. After extracting the downloaded archive, you should collect the texts of each file, organize them as a dataframe and store it as a CSV file. For this, you can run the code of Listing 1 on the same path where you have aclImdb folder."

Then, write a function to preprocess the texts and apply it in each review cell of the dataframe entries. The function must lowercase the text. It must also replace every number occurrence (integer or float) with a single ‘#’ symbol. Furthermore, you should make sure to keep (or save and add again) all smiley symbols which are very helpful sentiment polarityanalysis features. Besides‘#’ and smileys, all other punctuation or special symbols must be removed.

    "In this task we created a basic vanilla model with and without parameter optimization. For optimization, we used the Keras tuner framework. Before creating the model, we defined the necessary parameters shown in the cell below. Before creating and training the model we prepared the data from task 2a. Therefore, we loaded the 'review_preprocessed.csv' file and split the data in a training and test set using the 'SPLIT_DATA' variable and using the random state for reproducibility. Next, we used the Tensorflow Tokenizer to vectorize a text corpus by turning them into a sequence of integers. Finally, we used Tensorflows pad_sequences to create a common max length by padding or cutting the review entries to a common length specified by the parameter 'UNIFORM_LENGTH'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we were able to create a basic vanilla model to predict the proximity of a movie review. We used the functional API of Keras and created an Input, Embedding, Convolution(1D), MaxPooling, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dropout and an Output layer. We added the dropout layer to deal with the overfitting of our model. The model summary is shown below. We compiled the model with the loss 'binary_crossentropy' loss, the 'adam' optimizer and the metrics as 'accuracy'. In the end, we used the fit function with BATCH_SIZE=16 and EPOCHS=3 variables and defined a validation split of 0.2. We evaluated the model with the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were also interested if the recommended parameters in the cell below would improve our accuracy further. Therefore, we used the Keras tuner framework with a Hyperband search to get more insight. The architecture was identical as before. We performed hyperparameter optimization over the following parameters: LEARNING_RATE, WORD_EMBEDDING_DIM, UNIFORM_LENGTH, CONV_FILTERS, KERNEL_SIZE, DROPOUT. \n",

    "The learning curve shows that the model is well-fit to the data, i.e. it is neither overfit nor underfit. Initially, we encountered overfitting as the training accuracy was much higher than the validation accuracy. To tackle this, we incorporated a dropout layer. Subsequently, the learning curves improved, and as we see, the training and validation accuracy is nearly equal by the second epoch. Classification accuracy of 0.87 on unseen data shows us that our model performs rather well at classifying the reviews."

      "this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn t have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decent but i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jean baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life br br i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion\n",

      "dungeon of harrow had a lot of things that could ve made this quite a good horror film creepy mansion a torture chamber a paranoid host a henchman a ghoul in the dungeon etc but sadly to say this wasn t made very well br br a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle his slave and a mute maid the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates of all things and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them and the mute maid who befriends them to torture and imprisonment sound not bad right br br well not quite i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen but now i hesitate because it had so much potential it can t really be called one of the worst however seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film all in all it s not a very good movie br br there is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride adorned in a tattered wedding dress this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene man i wish this was a better movie br br this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late night chiller but ultimately took all the wrong turns i suggest someone remake this one\n",

      "i usually don t write reviews but i can t understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers br br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasn t even funny any more the same old stories you ve probably seen read a couple of times already living toys evil things from other dimensions and it s not just that these stories aren t innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés i d prefer e g chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and don t even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film student s project gone wrong blood or gore erm nothing worth mentioning br br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn t seen read that many scary stories yet although i d rather recommend beyond belief now that s what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the # points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting\n",

      "babette s feast and the horse s mouth are the two most insightful accurate films on what it is to be a real artist the key lines in babette s feast are not as some other commentators here have said an artist is never poor but two lines that come before and after it br br i was able to make them happy when i gave of my very best throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist give me the chance to do my very best br br i spent nine years producing experimental multi media music theater in san francisco raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers actors designers etc and the artists i supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best they were just like babette they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work babette s art is fine french cooking and for her to perform her art at its very best costs # # francs when after years in political exile from france isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak scandinavian coast she suddenly gets a windfall of # # francs she does what every real artist would do she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best and so she does it she spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist the twist in the movie is that we don t know she is such an artist until she is actually cooking and serving the meal up until then she appears to be just a working class french lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen and is very serious her husband and son were murdered in paris violence in # br br to such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it that is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters or to the religious community it was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect indeed she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them after the meal she is sitting alone sipping some wine not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted she is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist br br that is why it is so satisfying and so important to the story that the general unexpectedly shows up for as babette knows instantly a general will know what she has placed before him and will appreciate it for there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it she is glad very glad he came in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner the only one she singles out for special treatment not either of the spinsters but she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it br br to anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first class parisian dinner as i have my father was naval attache to paris in the # s and i had my honeymoon in france this dinner and babette s satisfaction in making it and the pleasure it brings to the diners is absolutely convincing if any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy it is a fine french meal cooked and served in france this movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients before the dinner the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome dredging up old resentments the old hymns fail to restore good fellowship people ignore them talk over them but the shared experience of sensual great art for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art contents the people puts them in a forgiving mood reconciles them and by making them happy encourages them to love each other and thus has a god like sacred effect of bringing peace this is the claim found in the modern art movement today that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful thus contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of christian belief it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that christian ritual cannot after all my years in the art world i have to say that this claim that art brings peace that religion cannot is overblown and invalid but it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film br br one last note at babette s arrival at the spinsters home a particular french general galliffet is named as the person who in # executed babette s husband and son and imposed a military rule that she had to flee at the end of the film as the general tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in paris many years before before # at the conclusion of some military maneuvers it turns out that this same galliffet was his host at the meal as the general tells the story french general galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman the only woman he would risk his life for of course that woman was babette thus ironically the same french general who said he honored babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from france forever\n",

      "a matter of life and death what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film powell and pressburger s visual imagination knows no bounds every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions the switches between the bold colours of the real world to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is the final court scene is also fantastic as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over peter david niven s operation br br all of the performances are spot on roger livesey being a standout and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful never has there been a more romantic film than this if there has i haven t seen it a matter of life and death is all about the power of love and just how important life is and jack cardiff s cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone the way he lights kim hunter s face makes her all the more beautiful what a genius he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting and the sound design is also impeccable the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time br br this is a true classic that can restore anyone s faith in cinema under appreciated on its initial release and by today s audiences but one of my all time favourites which is why i give this film a # # in a word beautiful\n",

      "visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made for tv quality the romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that doesn t make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized perhaps a nice under the blanket on a cold night freebie on cable but i certainly wouldn t recommend paid rental or purchase i m sure the soundtrack is wonderful though\n",

      "jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non prejudicial infective organism br br stefan tom wlaschiha journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father s scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini s opera turandot which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera a police investigator louise tolliver irit levi and her companion cop kalene parker follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father s theory he encounters a strange lad jeffrey jim thalman with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs richard conti who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects how this all come to an end is the play of the film a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders br br while tom wlaschiha jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of nessun dorma as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing grady harp february #\n",

      "i was very disappointed in this film the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors but this just seemed to be filler there may have been a deep meaning behind it but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys br br i would highly recommend his other works to people but certainly not this one as i watched it i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period but it never did at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way i could only say to myself what was that br br there were a few really striking parts of the film but not enough to warrant sitting through it again\n",

      "the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan the mega disappointing mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film it s a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they ve got big movie stars onboard written and directed by vijay krishna acharya tashan is what you d describe as a road movie but one that s going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call centre executive who s hired to teach english to bhaiyyaji that s anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool jimmy s got his eye on pooja the gangster s pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to swindle her boss of # crore rupees determined to recover his money and also to punish both jimmy and pooja bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan pandey the gangster s faithful aide from kanpur who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that s hidden across the length and breadth of the country much like those bad eighties potboilers tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot but the treatment s so over the top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that garish item song in the desert the bullet dodging action scene at a rajasthani fort kareeena s bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala and believe it or not even a dhanno style horse driven tonga in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because you re just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making what s more i don t think they cared either the film reeks of arrogance arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an overcooked stew there are films that kill you softly and then there s tashan a film that kills you with excess packaged snazzily with glossy finish camera work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn t hold borrowing narrative from tarantino and style from stephen chow doesn t help either because they don t blend with the film s wafer thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil kapoor s grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists and saif ali khan fumbles through the film foolishly unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over the top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is salvaged to some extent it s thanks to akshay kumar s irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when he s cupping his crotch repeatedly and you scowl when he delivers those double meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he s up there despite some good music from vishal shekhar the songs seem like they re only prolonging your misery well that s because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didn t know tashan means style i m sorry to say this film has none\n",

      "the filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly we never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another whenever that happens supposedly the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby and when a man is attacked by it he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won t fall to the ground this is still not the worst alien rip off around the two xtro films are even worse for example it s actually sufficiently entertaining if you ve got # minutes to spare # #\n",

      "after a chance encounter on the train a young couple spends a single night strolling the streets of vienna discussing life and love the primary reason to see before sunrise is to watch a young julie delpy deliver her lines as celine this sexy brainy soulful brown eyed blond is sort of a cross between brigitte bardot and joni mitchell as they were in their mid twenties risking overstatement celine is practically the ideal woman unusually beautiful and very feminine while being natural unpretentious introspective and selflessly loving we can easily forgive that she is a bit eccentric and talks a blue streak for her sincere intelligent remarks are occasionally penetrating further her varied expressions are nothing short of captivating and she speaks english with a french accent that is very endearing br br if there is a fly in the ointment of this good movie it would have to be her unkempt and disheveled costar ethan hawke as jessie comes off like a vaguely appealing slob sort of a maynard g krebs of the nineties attempting to appear detached and nonchalant he sort of drags himself through certain shots his pants fit poorly his tee shirt is coming untucked his wavy dark hair his most attractive feature needs a good washing and someone really should have showed him how to properly trim his youthful goatee nevertheless he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two week train ride around europe so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine his oft cynical observations and wry sense of humor seem to impress the unapologetically romantic celine although she is occasionally disturbed by the extent of his alienation when he finally admits to her that he is utterly sick of himself and likes being near her because he feels like a different person in her presence we know he is getting somewhere br br after blowing their collective funds on a series of cafes bars and silly diversions they agree that because they may never see one another again they should make the most of it jesse bums a bottle of red wine off a sentimental bartender so that he and his newfound lady love may repair to a local park in the middle of the night to lie on the grass looking up at the moon and the stars and watching the sun come up br br given his boundless luck in the romance department it is especially irksome when jessie as the very definition of a naive jerk foolishly allows this wonderful young lady to slip from his grasp he contents himself with a half baked plan quickly devised at the railroad station when he bids her adieu to reunite at the same spot in half a year when the appointed time comes you just know this beautiful and unusual girl will be involved with another perhaps even married and pregnant for whatever reason she probably won t show while jesse who ends up working at target or if he s lucky the local library will go back to vienna desperate to see her again only to wind up alone br br despite what for me was a very discouraging conclusion before sunrise is a beautiful movie i highly recommend both it and the sequel before sunset\n",

      "this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn t have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was decent but i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jean baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life br br i apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion\n",

      "skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox which includes both versions of this flick which i ll paraphrase to the tune of sci fi score by george antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b movie hell all photographed by will thompson who did plan # from outer space maniac you don t know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like self produced b or c grade noir wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you otherwise get a copy of screamplay a modern low budget expressionist masterpiece\n",

      "dungeon of harrow had a lot of things that could ve made this quite a good horror film creepy mansion a torture chamber a paranoid host a henchman a ghoul in the dungeon etc but sadly to say this wasn t made very well br br a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle his slave and a mute maid the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates of all things and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them and the mute maid who befriends them to torture and imprisonment sound not bad right br br well not quite i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen but now i hesitate because it had so much potential it can t really be called one of the worst however seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film all in all it s not a very good movie br br there is a very gothic suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride adorned in a tattered wedding dress this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene man i wish this was a better movie br br this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late night chiller but ultimately took all the wrong turns i suggest someone remake this one\n",

      "i usually don t write reviews but i can t understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average tv watchers br br i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché it wasn t even funny any more the same old stories you ve probably seen read a couple of times already living toys evil things from other dimensions and it s not just that these stories aren t innovative they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés i d prefer e g chucky and silent hill over those two episodes anytime and don t even ask about the visual effects the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second awful looks like some film student s project gone wrong blood or gore erm nothing worth mentioning br br it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn t seen read that many scary stories yet although i d rather recommend beyond belief now that s what i call a decent mystery tv show but for an adult horror fan this is worthless i only gave the # points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography especially in the second episode and some nice acting\n",

      "following a roughly # year rocky road on nbc it was decided to do just one last super installment the series had been on the bubble several times thanks to not having the numbers that would qualify it as a block buster of a tv hour it had always had a sizable hard core of hard corps of followers br br it was almost as if the series with the full title of homicide life on the street # # was a sort of mr in between of series it was too big to just cancel but too small to get a case of rabid ratings ravings over br br during the precarious tenure on friday evenings they had presented some of the best and most daringly artistic of hourly dramas there i ve said it artistic artistic but please remember we mean artistic but not just phony pretentious pedantic politically correct preaching br br when at last it was a sure thing that it was the end of the line for homicide this super episode was prepared as this # hour made for tv movie br br looking at all the past seasons happenings and parade of regular characters the production team went out and gave us what proved to be a super send off br br our story as we join the story we find that baltimore homicide unit commanding officer lt al giardello has pulled the pin retired from the job that is but g isn t ready to really retire retire yet so instead of a rocking chair o a fishing rod we find that al is running for mayor of charm city br br while out in the city making some campaign stops and speeches the former detective lieutenant takes an assassin s bullet alive but in a comatose state he is taken to the hospital br br news spreads quickly and as if officially summoned we find all of the detectives of the baltimore unit we ve seen on the show showing up to offer their services and assistance there is a great meeting of all of these former and present gumshoes as they pitch in and follow every lead and possibility of a lead br br the producer found a way to deal with those who had died previously in bringing their memory into the story they managed to answer some long standing questions and even introduced some here to unrevealed ones the whole story winds up the series in a most satisfying and original way but at least for now we ll leave that as classified br br in wrapping up everything into a neat little package this tv movie surely gets our endorsement as for grading the homicide movie we must give it an a or a even but no matter the grade here it didn t score as high as a typical weekly episode\n",

      "one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the cannibal connoisseur are there such people i didn t know but if you are one of them hey have a ball the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow pun intended even if like me you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur i have been an avid horror fan for about # years now although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago and i guess i owe my short lived interest in these groan inducing movies strangely enough to china s total disregard for copyright laws you see i bought a two disc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes films for # yuan about # which turned out to include last cannibal world mountain of the cannibal god eaten alive cannibal holocaust next with nicholas cage and something called voodoo lagoon along with blade # # in chinese nice br br being a second sequel i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland later you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a training exercise lock up your daughters br br before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister who looks nothing like her in any way but she s willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn t matter it seems that after shooting one of his victims the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie not used to big city life ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van br br the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheila s sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior but other than the film the guy is a complete mystery as the piteous police chief laments we know nothing about him except that he s dead poor guy he must be getting a headache from all this i recommend a nap luckily sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it s nothing in the search for her sister perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature since the police are clearly going to be no help br br obviously nothing new is added to this miniscule sub genre quite the contrary cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature a process they call purification personally i prefer just peeing outside occasionally br br one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members an overweight guy who looks like he took a three day weekend from the office to appear in this movie as he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection he warns her if you don t believe in jonas and purification through pain god help you he then gives her a shot and when she winces from the tiny pinch he politely apologizes to her i sense a true believer in this guy br br as far as the gore there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name the acting is astonishingly bad as can be expected and interestingly enough the editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective br br unfortunately i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane cults in order to relate to anyone in the movie there are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place which make it more and more difficult to understand why sheila s sister decided to turn her back on normal society i m all for individualism and doing your own thing but come on br br after a while the movie descends even further into your basic run of the mill escape movie just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory glory hallelujah in film history wow br br note in this movie a woman is raped with a severed snake if you need any more reason never to watch it seek professional help avoid this mess at all costs\n",

      "reading through most of the other reviews i tend to agree with most of the comments the one thing that i would add is the disjointed way the movie has been directed and produced i think that some of these new wave movie makers think that they are being clever using unusual sometimes jerky camera angles and flitting from one scene to another it goes down well with these movie festivals and with some of these indie type critics but it spoils the movie for me i noticed in the reviews one comment saying that none of this movie makers films have become blockbusters this would maybe prove my point as the film has that rushed to finish feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film appears to be lacking a smooth flow as for the comment about kiefer sutherland being a big name to put on the poster i would bet he cringed when watching the final cut this is a story with real potential spoilt by trying to be different in it s production worth watching but not many would come back for a second view\n",
