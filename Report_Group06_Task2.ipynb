    "Task-2 is about exploring the potential of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for text classification and more specifically for sentiment analysis [12]. The generic CNN architecture you need to use is depicted in Figure 1. The dataset to be used is the IMDB Movie review dataset described in [16]. It consists of 25 000 positive and 25 000 negative movie reviews and is available for free. There are also 50 000 unlabeled samples which will not be used for this task. After extracting the downloaded archive, you should collect the texts of each file, organize them as a dataframe and store it as a CSV file. For this, you can run the code of Listing 1 on the same path where you have aclImdb folder."

    "Task: In this step you will perform preprocessing of the review part of each data sample. Start by printing the raw review field of a dataframe sample with index X (you pick X yourself). Then, write a function to preprocess the texts and apply it in each review cell of the dataframe entries. The function must lowercase the text. It must also replace every number occurrence (integer or float) with a single ‘#’ symbol. Furthermore, you should make sure to keep (or save and add again) all smiley symbols which are very helpful sentiment polarityanalysis features. Besides‘#’ and smileys, all other punctuation or special symbols must be removed. After applying the function in the entire dataframe print the preprocessed text of the same sample X to show how it changed."

      "it s partly bad luck for illuminata that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk but a whole lot more ponderously br br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer s life but there s a whole lot of orson welles ish ego in this produced by directed by lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz with an adorable cameo by their son br br each actor gets his her moment literally in the spotlight but there s so many masques or set pieces that seem like # th century parlor games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a diva christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film br br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written # # #\n",

      "from the opening shots of the lead actor we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of normal life br br eric lartigau the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives yet without the help support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work the use of facial image throughout the film is superb and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family mother is spot on br br while there are more than enough laughs in the movie it still deals with single parents adoption and the strength of family in society truly rewarding to watch and again one that only the french seam capable to make br br so far one of the best # or so films i have seen this year and well worth a five start rating i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages\n",

      "the word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment br br as can be expected with these screenwriters yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless redundant and downright silly contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchum s performance not very good this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest ken takakura and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young intelligent feeling thug respectively br br the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy things are set in motion by the mitchum character s asking the takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions the error quickly becomes evident but the sense of honor demands they must not back off so they start sneaking around shooting in all directions wielding swords and wrecking their friend s arty apartment although the guy pleads with them stop it please all through the corresponding fight bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchum s character making his point if you give him your little finger i will give you mine well it s the least he can do can t he so he pulls out a knife takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity outside the frame luckily it was a moment which probably should have been solemn it just made me laugh br br the use of locations is very good in this movie i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake takaragaike an interesting futuristic building by architect sachio otani the kyoto protocol was signed there to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollack s more recent documentary sketches of frank o gehry which is about architecture and nothing else\n",

      "even by the lowered standards of # s slasher movies this one stinks the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a forbidden part of forest which burned in the # s and apparently left a sole angry survivor fast forward actually you ll want to fast forward through much of this mess to the present day where a couple of campers are butchered the teens follow in their wake while a semi concerned park ranger a sleepwalking jackie coogan and his healthier cohort who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run of the mill nature footage padding finally more killings but nothing you haven t seen a zillion times before if you want to see the kids butchered opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the # th over this\n",

      "i rented the dubbed english version of lensman hoping that since it came from well known novels it would have some substance while there were hints of substance in the movie it mostly didn t rise above the level of kiddie cartoon maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book or it lost a lot in the dubbed version or maybe even the source novels were lightweight but for whatever reason there wasn t much there br br i noticed lots of details that were derivative sloppy poorly dramatized or otherwise deficient some examples the opening scenes looked borrowed from the # star gate scene and the star wars image of hyperspace the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized r # d # br br it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars but mercifully since the humor doesn t work gives up on comedy and plays it serious in that sense it s superior to the star wars franchise which started with a clever sense of humor and eventually deteriorated to jar jar s annoying silliness br br the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field dumping silage onto unharvested crops rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already harvested rows or into a truck corn maize was pouring out the grain chute but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field br br when it was time for kim s father had to face his fate there wasn t any dramatic weight to the scene that could have been partly the fault of the english language voice actor but the drawings didn t show much weight either kim s reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing br br similarly when a character named henderson was killed chris showed very little reaction even though they were apparently supposed to have been close henderson s death is no spoiler his name isn t revealed until his death scene she seems to promptly forget him someone s expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case there s at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris br br on several occasions villains fail to accomplish their orders a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths i can t say whether that s lifted from star wars or if that comes from an earlier source possibly the lensman books br br there s a scene where a space ship crash lands as it plunges toward the ground parts are break off the ship but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands br br while in most cases chris seems like a competent tough space hero there s a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress someone tough enough to get over henderson s death so quickly should at least be able to shout help it s got me and i can t reach my gun instead of just shrieking br br the character with the most personality almost too much at times is d j bill he sounded like wolfman jack the d j in american graffiti i wonder if he s as well voiced in the original language br br two planets in the movie exploded the explosions were unimpressive and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars to its credit however the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star s primary weapon the dialog had a good interesting explanation for the cause many other explosions in the movie did look good just not the planetary explosions br br some of the sound effects are very cheesy as if borrowed from a late # s video game some of the images look like primitive video games and some influence from tron is visible too on the other hand the sound effects are often pretty decent although that emphasizes the cheesy sounding parts the art is good too particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy looking computer graphics br br finally there s the story if a movie tells a good story it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings but the plot here was pretty lightweight a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship and acquires a great power he doesn t understand he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful unredeemably evil enemy he makes friends learns about his special power and grows into a young man if he is persistent and virtuous enough he might even defeat the evil enemy details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline but there s very little more than that in this movie br br in the end it s just a kiddie cartoon but then since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children maybe it doesn t need to be anything more than that\n",

      "it s funny how instinct warns you of something for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn t remember where nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was maybe i m psychic br br mild spoilers br br the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time i don t know about you but i m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language especially if it s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night yeah he s a serious badass mofo in fact he s so bad and i don t mean the acting i ll get to that in a moment that he s impossible to take seriously and this is before he s executed only to return as elton john elvis a french chef etc i wonder if keith david got paid for this because he looks lke he s having so much fun on screen that s the only reason he s playing the role what a pity this reviewer didn t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury hey maybe the producers could send me keith s fee gawd only knows i deserve it br br i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn t guessed and my main beef isn t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence if like me you ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you ll know violence is an obscene painful thing but judge and jury will have you believe that if you re thrown through a window crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs it could of course be argued that any film starring sly arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain\n",

      "follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit this time the first african american cuba gooding after president truman desegregates the armed forces through the u s navy s deep sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot robert deniro if the program weren t bad enough it s got to be located in bayonne new jersey br br there s nothing wrong with the performances robert de niro activates his southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively cuba gooding raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south is the expectable paragon of rectitude the girls one could hardly call them women are charleze theron and lonette mckee they have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense other decent performers powers boothe and hal holbrook have even more perfunctory roles br br that s about it almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer a ship is called a boat robert de niro salutes indoors uncovered after a brutal assault on hospital personnel he s transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted somebody shouts i m outta here in the early # s maybe it was a common expression at the time if so my bad people address each other by rank lieutenant boatswain s mate commander as they do in the army whereas in the navy they are simple mister if an officer or addressed by their last name if enlisted i didn t bother to check if there was a rank called senior master chief in # br br cuba gooding has a tough row to hoe everyone in the navy it seems hates negroes except for one guy from wisconsin he stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class it s like the scene in animal house in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a sikh a black man and a blind kid br br gooding is an enlisted man a second class petty officer he manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school in one of their arguments she pleads with him she just wants to be a doctor and he should join her quit the navy and lead a quiet life and just let life pass you by he retorts yes yes just be a doctor s spouse and let life pass you by you can wave to it from the golf course in boca raton br br these kinds of flicks were common enough in world war ii bombardier airial gunner that sort of thing cheap as they often were they had some educational features you learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner here the technical details are skipped over perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them except boyle s law which we learned in high school chemistry br br i couldn t follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this wouldn t exist if i got the mechanical problems right it was because i guessed correctly the direction is no help either the movie abounds in close ups so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had and the emergencies are confusing because they re ill focused br br why go on want to see a better example of this kind of movie almost any will do except maybe g i jane in which the abused hero is a heroin try the training camp scenes in the young lions there the victim is a jew or try from here to eternity in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on just like cool hand luke no easy excuses are offered because easy excuses are too easy br br thoroughly formulaic and not well done\n",

      "i watched this movie after seeing it on broadway i love the broadway musical and i love the movie i watched the movie like it was not related to the broadway show i am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so i developed a philosophy really early assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it is br br i danced for # years before i had to make a choice i was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but i wasn t super talented i was however super talented as a show rider i was told by my dance instructor and my trainer who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that i had to make a choice when i turned # that i needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding # hours a day # days a week and dedicate to one or the other so i dearly love dancing and i love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies i just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction it is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it i love the movie i love the broadway musical\n",

      "it s partly bad luck for illuminata that it comes out after shakespeare in love as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk but a whole lot more ponderously br br there are scenes that come alive as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer s life but there s a whole lot of orson welles ish ego in this produced by directed by lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz with an adorable cameo by their son br br each actor gets his her moment literally in the spotlight but there s so many masques or set pieces that seem like # th century parlor games bill irwin talks susan sarandon gets to be a diva christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain a gay critic the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film br br the art and set direction are marvelous though quite dark this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie originally written # # #\n",

      "am i the only person who believes this american version is far better than the # english film the english version has no suspense looks antique and very low budget and has unexceptional acting except for peter lorre the # version besides having top production values shows james stewart as the perfect innocent american abroad and gives doris day her best role ever of particular note is the music the music of the american film is almost classic compare the albert hall sequences of both and you will agree that the bernard herrmann music is far more exciting than the original version even though it s basically the same music the only flaw in the # film is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy shop i would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the english version is better\n",

      "from the opening shots of the lead actor we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of normal life br br eric lartigau the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives yet without the help support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work the use of facial image throughout the film is superb and his clever positioning of the senior member of the family mother is spot on br br while there are more than enough laughs in the movie it still deals with single parents adoption and the strength of family in society truly rewarding to watch and again one that only the french seam capable to make br br so far one of the best # or so films i have seen this year and well worth a five start rating i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages\n",

      "this show is pretty alright and fun to watch its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining br br i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons this show has completely changed around in the first season it was more about science and animals all that is gone now in the season and third season its more about her life and dating ever since that gay kid ben came along this show has sucked the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy disney took a turn for the worse i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore they re all garbage\n",

      "a man named jerry comes into possession of an ancient aztec doll however this creepy little figure is possessed by an evil spirit which takes over jerry s body and pushes him to spill the blood i have seen two other horror movies the dorm that dripped blood and the kindred made by stephen carpenter and jeffrey obrow and i must say that the power doesn t disappoint either the plot is slow moving but there are some effective human goo effects and a little bit of gore the scene of a female tabloid reporter being attacked by arms that come ripping out of a mattress is a hoot i liked this low budget horror movie and you should too if you are into # s horror genre # out of #\n",

      "the word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations it aggravates male dumbness and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people anybody who does not agree should not care to continue reading this comment br br as can be expected with these screenwriters yakuza is an engaging crime thriller with quite a lot of respect for the ethnical background against which it is acted out friends of gore and violence will not be disappointed either but especially towards the end violence becomes somewhat pointless redundant and downright silly contrary to other reviewers i found robert mitchum s performance not very good this is an actor who definitely did not improve with age he looks like a tired janitor it does not go too well with the part and his air of detachment which made him such an impressive screen presence in earlier years comes through as either confusion or lack of interest ken takakura and richard jordan are very good as man of honor and young intelligent feeling thug respectively br br the best way to stand this movie is seeing it as a tragic comedy things are set in motion by the mitchum character s asking the takakura character a favor based on wrong assumptions the error quickly becomes evident but the sense of honor demands they must not back off so they start sneaking around shooting in all directions wielding swords and wrecking their friend s arty apartment although the guy pleads with them stop it please all through the corresponding fight bodies start piling up and the story ends with mitchum s character making his point if you give him your little finger i will give you mine well it s the least he can do can t he so he pulls out a knife takes a resigned breath and starts sawing off said extremity outside the frame luckily it was a moment which probably should have been solemn it just made me laugh br br the use of locations is very good in this movie i particularly liked the scenes filmed in and around the international conference hall on lake takaragaike an interesting futuristic building by architect sachio otani the kyoto protocol was signed there to me the presentation of architecture seems better here than in sydney pollack s more recent documentary sketches of frank o gehry which is about architecture and nothing else\n",
